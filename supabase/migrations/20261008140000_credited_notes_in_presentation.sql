-- Bar-credited drinks' notes went missing from the drink page.
--
-- 20261008050000 made app_item_presentation read notes from
-- credited_drink_notes when the row has none. 20261008100000 then rebuilt the
-- view from the 20261001150000 definition to add is_core, which put plain
-- c.notes back. This is that view with both: credited notes, and is_core at
-- the end. Same columns and order, so CREATE OR REPLACE is enough.
